\section{Discussion}
Lessons learnt

\subsection{Challenges encountered}
Discuss numerical challenges, precision issues, memory constraints
Discuss some of the auxiliary computational approaches used such as eigenvalue solvers etc

Mention how most other reports like MsetCCA and GCCA compare effect of following on acc:
- number of harmonics 
- number of channels
obv not possible in this project.

Mention somewhere that the networking aspect with MQTT can stream data up to 5Hz but was only required to do so at around 1Hz (2s sampling window with 50\% overlap)



\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Evaluate if objectives initially laid out were achieved
- if not, why not
- if they had been stated differently/more realistically, would the outcome have been different?
- what would need to be done differently next time
