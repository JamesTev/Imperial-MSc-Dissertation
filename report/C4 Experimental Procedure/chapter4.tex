\section{Apparatus}

In general, EEG systems are comprised of the following core elements \cite{teplan-eeg-measurement}, \cite{bci-survey-nicolas-alonso}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item electrodes: placed on the scalp of the subject to record raw electrical potentials. 
    \item signal processing elements: amplifiers and filters are typically employed before the signals are digitised
    \item analogue-to-digital converter (ADC): digitises measured signal for manipulation in a computer or microcontroller
    \item computer or microcontroller: facilitates data processing, computation and storage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EEG hardware}
\subsubsection{OpenBCI Ganglion}
As the Imperial NGNI hardware prototype was still under development for a large part of this project, experimentation was initially done on a Ganglion bio-sensing kit made by \href{https://shop.openbci.com/products/ganglion-board?variant=13461804483}{OpenBCI} (OpenBCI, New York, USA). This kit was chosen due to the fact that it is relatively low-cost at 374.99 USD, open-source and has been scientifically validated as in \cite{autthasan-single-chan-ssvep}, \cite{peterson-bci-survey}. Furthermore, it is a relatively simple platform with sensing capabilities that are likely the most comparable to those anticipated for the NGNI prototype.

        \label{fig:openbci-subfigs}
\end{figure}
As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:openbci-subfigs}, the Ganglion board offers four active channels that. All four channels were using during experimentation as it was more convenient to exclude data from certain channels in post-processing than only measuring a subset of channels. Although wet electrodes can also be used with this kit, in accordance with the project constraints mentioned in Chapter \ref{chapter:introduction}, dry electrodes were used. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:openbci}, the four active electrodes have spiky nodules to increase surface pressure and thus improve contact quality with the scalp. For reference and comparison, some core features of the Ganglion board are provided below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microchip MCP3912 four channel 24-bit Delta-Sigma analogue frontend
    \item 200Hz sampling rate
    \item Simblee Bluetooth 4.0 module
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NGNI Prototype I}

As alluded to in Chapter \ref{chapter:introduction}, the hardware to be used in this project was supplied by the Imperial NGNI Lab. All hardware prototypes developed by the Lab were based on the Espressif ESP32; a low-cost, low-power SoC (system-on-chip) based on the Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Features of the ESP32 that are relevant to this project include \cite{esp32-digikey}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item dual-core, 240MHz CPU
    \item onboard FPU
    \item 12-bit SAR ADC
    \item 4x SPI, 2x I2C, 3x UART interfaces
    \item up to 600 DMIPS performance
    \item ultra low-power (ULP) co-processor
    \item 4 MiB SRAM
    \item integrated Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and BLE
\end{itemize}
The ESP32 is extremely capable for its low price tag of around 3.6 USD \cite{esp32-digikey}. Its dual-core CPU is also particularly attractive as it could allow decoding-related computation and network communication to happen concurrently.

Figure \ref{fig:esp-hardware} shows the electronic hardware prototype developed by the NGNI Lab. In this design, the active components directly involved in the normal functioning of the system are independently located on a `target' board. A second programmer board was created to enable serial communication with the target; most commonly in order to flash new firmware to it during development. The programmer board uses six spring-loaded pogo pins to make momentary contact with corresponding pads on the target board during development. These 6 pins, and their corresponding pads on the target board, can be seen directly in the centre of Figure \ref{fig:esp-hardware-both}. A 3D printed housing was created to facilitate correct contact between the boards during development. As depicted in the image of the programmer board in Figure \ref{fig:esp-hardware-programmer}, it also features contact points for probing a few selected pins/junctions on the target board such as: the ADC output, the inverting pin of the analogue amplifier, the output of the analogue filter and all relevant supply voltage references. In addition, two momentary push-buttons connected to the \texttt{BOOT0} and \texttt{EN} pins of the ESP32 SoC are included in order to allow hardware resets and to control the entry state upon reset: bootloader mode or normal operating mode. 

It should be noted that this first revision of the electronic hardware prototype is designed for coupling with \textit{two} active electrodes but only allows for \textit{differential} signal measurements between these electrodes. Consequently, only a single `channel' is recorded by the ADC in the ESP32. A third reference electrode is also expected in order to offer a common voltage reference point between the two active channels.

The very first complete EEG headband prototype comprising electronic and mechanical hardware is shown in Figure \ref{fig:frank
}. This version did not include any means of adjusting the circumference of the band of the electrode positions within it besides having to drill new holes in it. As such, this makeshift prototype was more intended to serve as a preliminary means of gathering real-life data using the electronic hardware. It was not designed (nor expected) to produce viable results for SSVEP decoding.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{NGNI Prototype II}
Guided by the first EEG headband prototype, a second, improved version was developed by the NGNI Lab. This version, pictured in Figure \ref{fig:final-headband-subfigs}, employed a flexible and adjustable strap mechanism. This enabled the band circumference to be adjusted so as to offer greater comfort for the user and ensure appropriate contact pressure with heads of any size or morphology. Furthermore, electrodes could be adjusted more easily thanks to the 3D-printed locator structures in which they were housed. These locator structures, seen in Figure \ref{fig:final-headband-electrodes}, allowed for greatly improved contact angles between the electrodes and the scalp surface compared to the first prototype. In particular, the slight pitch and yaw flexibility introduced by the electrode locators allowed the electrodes to remain perpendicular to the undulating scalp surface, thereby maximising contact surface area. However, their stiffness also prevented excessive pitch and yaw deviations which may have arisen if the electrodes were housed directly in the flexible headband strap.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\subsection{Data acquisition}

\subsection{Testing and verification}
In order to verify that signals measured from by the BCI system were valid, several checks were devised. 

\subsubsection{Basic firmware test}
The first very basic test involved verifying the integrity of the firmware on board the ESP32. This involved testing basic peripheral functionality such as toggling an LED connected to a GPIO pin and sampling a known, fixed value from the ADC. Storage and retrieval of data from flash, checking floating point precision and verifying operations from third party modules were also checked. 

\subsubsection{Alpha band test}
As mentioned briefly in Section \ref{subsection:nature-of-eeg-signals}, EEG signal energy related to visual processing typically occurs in the \textit{alpha} band between 8 and 13Hz and can be measured around the occipital region of the brain. As alpha energy is pronounced when the eyes are closed and attenuated when they are open, this phenomenon can be used as a basic test of the validity of a BCI. If signal energy as measured by the BCI in the occipital region follows this pattern, it suggests that acquired signals are not simply random noise. It should be noted, however, that individuals show varying levels of alpha reactivity and the difference in energy under these two conditions may not be significant in all individuals. 

\subsubsection{Digital signal processing tests}
In order to test the integrity of digital signal processing (DSP) elements in the BCI system, the following checks were employed. 

\subsubsection{Artificial signal decoding test}


\subsection{Demonstration procedure}
During the Royal Society exhibition, audience members attending remotely from various locations will be presented a mobile-friendly, lightweight web page with two or three flickering squares that will form the SSVEP stimuli. These squares will be programmed to flicker at predetermined stimulus frequencies $f_1, \dots, f_n$. Each stimulus will correspond to an action - such as `up' or `down' - that will control an avatar in a cooperative multiplayer game or simulation. The core objective of the designed BCI system is to decode $f_1, \dots, f_n$ in order to interpret each user's desired action (i.e. discern which stimulus square they are focused on).
